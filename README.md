# Web Scraping and Regression

## Overview

The film industry is one of the most influential and high-profile industries in the world, with an annual revenue of over $136 billion USD in 2018 alone [\[1\]](https://www.ibisworld.com/global/market-research-reports/global-movie-production-distribution-industry/). However, the budget for most films is a not insignificant outlay, with some sources stating between $70 and $90 million USD for the average film [\[2\]](https://parlaystudios.com/blog/feature-film-budget-breakdown/).

With that in mind, it behooves the discerning film studio to analyze which variables most affect profit.

## Proposal

This project seeks to answer the question, **"What makes a profitable film in the USA, and are there common variables among films that are profitable and successful?"**

We will use linear regression to model the behavior of profit as a function of various input variables.

## Data

BoxOfficeMojo.com contains listings of every film released, along with variables like release date, budget, domestic gross total, distributor, MPAA rating, runtime, cast, director, etc.
